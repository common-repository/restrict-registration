Use simple blacklists and whitelists to control who can and cannot register on 
your blog.

== Description ==
"Restrict Registration" is a plugin for WordPress that allows you to control 
who is registering on your blog. This plugin uses simple blacklists and 
whitelists to define who can register for your blog, and who is restricted. Use 
simple literal matching, flexible asterisk wildcard matching, or powerful 
regular expression matching: it's your choice! The options page is clear and 
easy to use. Set your lists, and you're done!

This plugin was inspired by WP-Deadbolt, but has been completely rewritten and 
redesigned, and several new features have been added.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin file above and put it in the wp-content/plugins folder of your WordPress installation.
2. Log into Wordpress, go to the Plugins section, and activate the plugin.
3. Go to the Users section, click on Restrict Registration, set your restrictions, and click Update.

== Screenshots ==
1. The admin panel for setting your restrictions.
2. This person is unable to register for your blog, due to your restrictions.

== Changelog ==
